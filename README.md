# PyQtQuadraticEquationSolvePlot
App for solving and plotting Quadratic Equations

### Discriminant
Distriminant: D = b^2 - 4ac
- when dicriminant is positive, equation has two real solutions
- when dicriminant is zero, equation has just one solution
- when dicriminant is negative, equation has two complex solutions

### Solution possibilies
- 3 type of solution are possible
  - D > 0    ->     2 real roots
  - D = 0    ->     1 real root
  - D < 0    ->     2 complex roots
